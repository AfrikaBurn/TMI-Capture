# Secure Login and Image tagging

We are wanting to move away from tools that have user tracking systems built in.

One thought is to tigh this to a tagging the photogalleries in a similar way that recapture 2 does.

In a group of 9 images, we could pre tag three with a common tag. For example, Ranger. The remain 6 images, would be randomly presented, allowing the user to select which had rangers in. 

This means the user would be forced to select correctly at least the three predefind images, as well as any other images that may contain a ranger.

Once an image has been highlighted by sufficient users to contain the tag, we can assume they are correct and add it to the safe reference images used by the users. 

We could later extend this to tagging the actual area in the picture the tag is relevent to, e.g. where the ranger is in the image. 

We can use any common images with in our community:
* Artworks
* Theme Camps
* Mutant Vehicles
* Gate
* Offcenter camp
* Sanctury
* Ranger HQ
* DPW
* etc.

We could also use this to educate people about things on site, for example: 
The Rangers are a group on nonconfrontational comunity representatives, helping people in any form of need. 
Then one of these questions:
* Ranger HQ is a large orange container, which of these images contain the Rangers HQ.
* Ranger's on patrol were orange, which images contain Rangers
* What situations can rangers help you with? (possible use case?)

There are many useful thing that could be added in this way.

# Other ideas

Language teaching version. E.g. a isiXhosa or san word.

## Cons
This does not consider the visually impared and how to support them.
